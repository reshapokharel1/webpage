## This is one of the webpages, I have created using all the tags, which I have learned till date.
## I used basic HTML tags like div, h1, p, ul, table, and img to structure and present the content, along with an external CSS file (utils1.css) for styling. There's also a short contact section and a table that shows how Nimo shines in emotional and thinking skills. This project helped me get more comfortable with HTML and made learning feel playful and creative. Thanks for swimming by!
